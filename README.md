# ü´Ä Heart Disease Risk Assistant

A powerful AI-powered web application that predicts heart disease risk from **natural language patient descriptions**.  
It leverages machine learning and LLMs (via Groq) to extract features, assess risk, provide personalized advice, and generate downloadable DOCX/Excel reports.

> The following steps explain the system flow:

1. **Natural Language Input**  
   User enters a plain English description of the patient's symptoms (e.g., age, chest pain, BP).

2. **LLM Feature Extraction**  
   Groq-hosted LLaMA3 model parses and extracts structured features (age, sex, cp, etc.) from the input.

3. **Heart Disease Prediction**  
   The structured features are scaled and passed to a trained Random Forest model to compute the risk percentage.

4. **LLM Explanation**  
   The LLM generates a formal explanation of the risk score in medical terms.

5. **Lifestyle Advice**  
   Static heart-health tips are provided (diet, sleep, exercise, etc.).

6. **Reference Links**  
   DuckDuckGo search fetches up to 3 links from trusted sources (e.g., Mayo Clinic, Wikipedia).

7. **Report Generation**  
   Generates a downloadable **DOCX** or **Excel** file with all results.

8. **Gradio Web Interface**  
   A user-friendly UI wraps all functionality in one place.

##  Getting Started

### 1.  Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is missing, create it manually with:

```
gradio
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
requests
python-docx
openpyxl
duckduckgo-search
langchain
langchain-core
langchain-community
langchain-groq
```

---

### 2.  Add Dataset

- Download the heart disease dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- Save it as:  
  ```
  heart.csv
  ```
- Place it in the **root directory** of your project.

---

### 3.  Set Groq API Key

Replace the placeholder in your code with your Groq API key:

```python
groq_api = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
```

>  Get your free API key here: [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

---

### 4.  Run the App

To launch the app locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

Or in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:

```python
demo.launch()
```

---

##  Example Input

Paste this into the Gradio app input box:

```
A 60-year-old male with chest pain type 3, BP 150, cholesterol 270, fasting sugar 1, ECG 0, heart rate 140, no angina, oldpeak 1.8, slope 1, ca 0, thal 2
```

---

##  Output Includes

-  Risk prediction score (e.g., **78.45%**)
-  Formal medical explanation from LLM
-  Heart-healthy lifestyle recommendations
-  Reference links (Wikipedia, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
-  Downloadable report (in DOCX or Excel format)
